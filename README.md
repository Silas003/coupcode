- start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Use Git for this purpose by running the command:
- git clone `https://github.com/GasApp0/backend.git`. Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the project directory using cd django-project.

- It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies efficiently. To set this up, run python -m venv venv. Activate this virtual environment by executing source `venv/bin/activate` on Unix or MacOS. For Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`.

- Next, install the necessary dependencies. This can be done easily by using the pip package installer. Simply run:
 `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required packages.

- The database configuration is an essential step in setting up your Django project. Modify the settings.py file to update the database configuration. For a development setup, you might use SQLite. Ensure that the DATABASES dictionary in settings.py is configured to use the correct database engine and name.

- So with the database use set `USE_SQLITE` in settings.py as True.

- Creating the necessary database tables is the next step. This can be accomplished by running python manage.py migrate. This command applies migrations and creates the required tables in the database.

- For administrative purposes, creating a superuser is vital. Execute python manage.py createsuperuser and follow the prompts to set the username, email, and password. This superuser account will be used to access the Django admin panel.

- To start the development server and view your project, use the command python manage.py runserver. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see your project in action.

- If any issues arise during the setup process, refer to the Django documentation or the resources provided to troubleshoot and resolve any problems.
